Introduction
This project aims to analyze house sales data in King County, USA. The goal is to build a predictive model to estimate house prices based on various features. The project is divided into four main sections: data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, model development, and model evaluation.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the King County House Sales dataset, which includes information about house prices and features such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and more. The dataset can be found here.

Project Steps
1. Data Wrangling
In this step, the raw data is cleaned and prepared for analysis. Tasks include:

Handling missing values
Converting data types
Removing duplicates
Feature engineering
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the underlying patterns in the data. Key activities include:

Visualizing the distribution of house prices
Analyzing the relationships between features and house prices
Identifying outliers and anomalies
3. Model Development
Various machine learning models are developed to predict house prices. The models used include:

Linear Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forests
Gradient Boosting Machines
4. Model Evaluation
The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R-squared (RÂ²)
